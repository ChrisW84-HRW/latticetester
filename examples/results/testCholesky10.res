=============================================================================
TestCholesky: Tests the Cholesky decomposition and BB with different 
  reduction strategies and different real types, with a trace.

Types: Int = NTL::ZZ, Real = double

Modulus m = 1021
Multiplier a = 211.
DUAL lattice,  Norm: L2NORM,  Decomposition: CHOLESKY.
Safety margin on the BB bounds: epsBounds = 0.
