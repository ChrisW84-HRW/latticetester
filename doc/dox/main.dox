\mainpage LatCommon: Common Classes

This library regroups the classes that are shared by LatMRG and by Lattice Builder.

Can be compiled so that matrices and vectors use the boost::numeric::ublas
backend or with the NTL backend.

Suggested reading:
- LatCommon::Coordinates
- LatCommon::Sequence
- LatCommon::CoordinateSets
